## Description

- Since it takes quite a lot of time and effort to make a README for your project, I figure why not at least generate a format.
- The generator makes a README.md for a project efficiently and organized without the need of starting from scratch. 
- User inputs were made possible with the inquirer package.

To use the README Generator, first run ```npm i``` in order to install the following npm package dependecies as specified in the  ```package.json```:
- ```inquirer``` : allows for prompted user inputs from the terminal 

The application can be invoked with node index.js within the assets directory

## Usage

First enter the assets directory ```cd assets```. Now you can run the program via ```node index.js```. Full in your inputs to the prompt accordingly and the currently existing README.md will be replaced and filled in with your formatted responses.
